You need to buy monitors for m desks. Each desk can have at most 2 monitors. Youâ€™re given a list of monitor prices, and for each desk, the total price of monitors should not exceed a given budget X. Find out how many monitors you can buy.

def max_monitors(arr, m, X):
    arr.sort()
    i, j = 0, len(arr) - 1
    desks_used = 0
    monitors_assigned = 0

    while i <= j and desks_used < m:
        if arr[i] + arr[j] <= X:
            # Pair i and j
            monitors_assigned += 2
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            # Use only j
            monitors_assigned += 1
            j -= 1
        desks_used += 1

    return monitors_assigned
