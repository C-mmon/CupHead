You are given location of n number of houses on a straight line and k street lights.
The street light has a power P value.

If a street light is located at location x, it will spread light from [x-P , x+P]

You need to find the minimum value of K so that we can light all the houses.

Example1:

houses[] = [1,2,3,4,5]
P = 1
output = 2

Example2:
houses[] = [7,2,4,6,5,9,12,11]
P = 2
output = 3
