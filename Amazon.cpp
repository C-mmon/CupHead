=> File fitering and search system . Ask was to how I would solve it.
I answered like to use decorator and factory and stratgey pattern . Obviously gave red flag , because interviewer was expecting like how would you take in query parameters . Told to use maybe class models for that , I didnt understand anything and had no idea how to do that. Got into union and intersection of queries .
